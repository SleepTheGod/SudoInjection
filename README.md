This script, created by SleepTheGod, attempts to activate a sudo token for the current user by copying a script (activate_sudo_token) to /tmp/ and making it executable. It first checks if sudo access is available, then retrieves the sudo timestamp directory. The script proceeds to find all running shell processes (bash, zsh, etc.) owned by the current user, excluding the script's own process. For each of these processes, it injects a command using gdb to trigger the execution of the activate_sudo_token script, effectively trying to authenticate with sudo privileges on the targeted processes. The output of each operation is suppressed to prevent any user-facing messages.
